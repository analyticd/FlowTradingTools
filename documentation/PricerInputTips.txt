I Navigation
============

Excel like in general.
Ctrl+Arrow goes to beginning or end of block.
Ctrl+Page Up/Down switches between tabs.
Right click or Menu key brings a contextual menu

II Changing price
=================

Changing the BID price will move the ASK by the same amount.
Changing the ASK price will only move the ASK price, therefore changing the BID/ASK spread.
There are three ways to change the price:
-input the price
-input the change by typing + or - before: so +1 adds 1pt.
-input the change in yield basis points by typing + or - before and b or B at the end: so +5b increases the yield by 5 basis points.
All numbers are rounded to the nearest 1/16th.
When inputting change in prices the following shortcuts are valid (and also work with - instead of +):
+12 -> +0.5 (not +12pts)
+14, +34 -> +0.25, +0.75
+18, +38, +58, +78
+116, +316, +516, +716, +916, +1116, +1316, +1516


III Changing size
=================

Sizes are in thousands (M). Just input the size individually in the bid and ask column, without any comma.


IV Multiple input
=================

Two types are supported: multiple cell selection and copy/paste from Excel.
Multiple cell selection: with the mouse or the keyboard (shift+arrows) you can select a BID range. The active cell MUST BE the cell at the TOP of the selected range. Input the change (for example +0.25) then press Enter, and that change will be applied to all the bonds in the range.
Copy/Paste from Excel: copy a range in Excel consisting of either BID and ASK (two columns) or BID ASK BID_SIZE ASK_SIZE (four columns). Select the top left BID in the Pricer, then right-click or Menu key and select Paste prices. Warning: this will only work if the columns are next to each other in the Pricer.
